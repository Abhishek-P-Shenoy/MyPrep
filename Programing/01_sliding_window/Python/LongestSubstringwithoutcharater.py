Problem
input --> ABCABABCD
output--> ABCD


All possibale solution:
1. Substring
    two pointer
    sliding Window
    hash map
2. longest 
3. Without repeating character

Not usefull:
sorting is not possible, so 2 pointer cant be used, substring i.e we need the placment is needed so two pointer cant be used.
solution :
sliding window with largest window

I x----------x J
in sliding window we will keep i and keep moving j that is growing the window with a role here we need to role from problem

here condition can be checked by saving it 
    hashmap  
    character array
and maintaing the count of each
